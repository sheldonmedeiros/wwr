    <h2>Sheldon Medeiros</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone my name is Sheldon and I am from the lovley island of Oah'u. I go by my Hawaiian name sometimes which is Lokahi and it mean unity in english. I am married with no kids yet but two dogs that I love to death.</p>
    <p>I orginally came here to Utah for school and tried to find a passion. I thought I found it with aviation but since I was diagnosed with ADHD I would have to do a 5,000 dollar test to make sure it was not to bad. Sadly being a poor college student I did not have the money to do so and so I was lost and my brother actually introduced me to HTML and Python and grew to love it. I love sports and video games and spend most of my free time on that. I am so excited to start this major in web so that I can learn the ins and outs of the thing I spend most of my time on the internet.</p>
    <p>Looking foward to meeting all of you and lets get this together!</p>
